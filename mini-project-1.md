# Mini-Project I: Forward Kinematics

## Overview
This mini-project has the following goals:
- Solidify your understanding on how to use the DH convention in determining forward kinematics equations
- **ADD MORE**
- Improve coding skills in Python

This assignment will count towards **15% of your final course grade**. It is a team-based assignment with a maximum of 3 students in a team.

## What to Do

1. Derive the DH parameters and implement the forward kinematics function for the 5DOF robot platform (with verification in the Viz tool)
2. Derive the inverse jacobian and implement a resolved-rate motion control (RRMC)
3. Implement the motion control through gamepad control of the 5DOF robot platform

## What to Submit

A **PDF submission** with the following:
- Derivation of the DH parameters and forward kinematics equations for the 5DOF robot platform
- Derivation of the jacobian matrix and inverse jacobian matrix for the robot arm
- Code showing all the functions you implemented
- Link to a screenshot video showing your verification using the viz tool for both forward position kinematics and velocity kinematics
- Link to a video showing gamepad control of the physical 5DOF robot arm
- Link to your team's Github repository with a reasonably setup README
- **Individual reflections** on the following questions:
    - What did you learn from this? What did you not know before this assignment?
    - What was the most difficult aspect of the assignment?
    - What was the easiest or most straightforward aspect of the assignment?
    - How long did this assignment take? What took the most time (PC setup? Coding in Python? Exploring the questions?)?
    - What did you learn about arm forward kinematics that we didn't explicitly cover in class?
    - What more would you like to learn about arm forward kinematics?

**TODO**: CA's help with creating a rubric for this submission

**TODO**: Provide code to aid robot control and gamepad interfacing
